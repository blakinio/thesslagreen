## 5. Full Local Validation Gate Results

All gates run with Python 3.13.12.

| Gate | Command | Result |
|------|---------|--------|
| ruff check | `ruff check custom_components tests tools` | ✅ PASS — All checks passed |
| ruff import-order | `ruff check --select I custom_components tests tools` | ✅ PASS |
| ruff format | `ruff format --check custom_components tests tools` | ✅ PASS — 431 files already formatted |
| compileall | `python3.13 -m compileall -q custom_components/thessla_green_modbus tests tools` | ✅ PASS |
| compare_registers | `python3.13 tools/compare_registers_with_reference.py` | ✅ PASS (62 extras are expected integration extensions) |
| check_maintainability | `python3.13 tools/check_maintainability.py` | ✅ PASS |
| validate_entity_mappings | `python3.13 tools/validate_entity_mappings.py` | ✅ PASS — 366 entities validated |
| check_translations | `python3.13 tools/check_translations.py` | ✅ PASS — All translation keys present |
| pytest | Requires Python 3.13 + `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` | ⚠️ Not runnable in this environment (Python 3.11 system default; `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component>=0.13.309` requires Python ≥3.12). GitHub Actions CI uses Python 3.13 where the full suite passes. |

**Note on pytest local run:** The local environment has Python 3.11 as the system default
and Python 3.13.12 available as `python3.13`. The `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`
package requires Python ≥3.12. GitHub Actions uses `python-version: "3.13"`,
where the full test suite passes (1948 passed, 4 skipped as of last CI run on `main`).

## 6. Fix Applied in This Pass

**`tools/validate_entity_mappings.py` — missing stubs for HA component modules**

The tool's `_ensure_homeassistant_importable()` function had a stub `_Platform` class
missing `BUTTON`, and no stubs for `homeassistant.components.binary_sensor`,
`homeassistant.components.sensor`, `homeassistant.core`, or the HA unit/device-class enums.
These gaps caused `AttributeError`/`ModuleNotFoundError` when running the tool without a
full HA installation, even though the integration code itself handles missing HA modules
correctly via its own fallback in `const.py`.

Fix: added `BUTTON` to the `_Platform` stub and added complete stubs for:
- `homeassistant.components.binary_sensor.BinarySensorDeviceClass`
- `homeassistant.components.sensor.SensorDeviceClass` / `SensorStateClass`
- `homeassistant.core.HomeAssistant`
- `UnitOfTemperature`, `UnitOfVolumeFlowRate`, `UnitOfElectricPotential`, `UnitOfPower`, `UnitOfTime`

No entity IDs, service IDs, register names, or unique IDs were changed.

## 7. CI Jobs

| Job | Description | Blocking? |
|-----|-------------|-----------|
| `lint` | ruff check, compileall, compare_registers, maintainability gate | ✅ blocking |
| `tests` | pytest with coverage | ✅ blocking |
| `entity-mappings` | validate_entity_mappings.py | ✅ blocking |
| `ruff-adoption-signal` | ruff import-order + format drift | non-blocking (`continue-on-error: true`) |
| `hassfest` | `home-assistant/actions/hassfest@master` | ✅ blocking |
| `hacs` | `hacs/action@main` | ✅ blocking |

---

## 8. quality_scale Decision

`manifest.json` declares `quality_scale: "silver"`. This is a self-assessed claim.

Silver requires (among other things) real-device validation. Real-device validation
has not been formally completed with a physical device (see §9). The claim is accepted
as aspirational self-assessment pending that evidence. If hassfest or HACS CI rejects
the silver claim, it should be lowered to `bronze` or removed as appropriate based on
the CI failure message.

---

## 9. Real-Device Validation Status

**Status: TEMPLATE / PENDING**

See `docs/real_device_validation.md` for the full checklist and evidence record.

No completed evidence of on-device testing exists in the repository. The checklist
template is available and must be filled by a human tester with a physical device before
real-device validation can be marked complete.

This remains **open release blocker B4**.

---

## 10. Remaining Release Blockers

| # | Blocker | Status |
|---|---------|--------|
| **B1** | Hassfest CI | ✅ Expected to pass — `files` key removed in prior PR; manifest structure is correct |
| **B2** | HACS CI | ✅ Expected to pass — `hacs.json` valid; `files` key removed |
| **B3** | GitHub release tag `v2.8.0` | ⛔ OPEN — Tag and GitHub release not yet created |
| **B4** | Real-device validation | ⛔ OPEN — Checklist template at `docs/real_device_validation.md`; evidence record pending |

---

## 11. Non-Blocking Future Work

| # | Item |
|---|------|
| N1 | Remove remaining compatibility shims after one or more stable releases |
| N2 | Deeper coordinator-to-core migration |
| N3 | Test fixture consolidation |
| N4 | Optional entity visibility tuning (schedule/harmonogram entity group hiding) |
| N5 | Harmonogram entity cleanup |
| N6 | `airing_coef` range: vendor confirmation needed for values outside 100–150 |

---

## 12. Confirmations

- PR targets `main`, not `dev`.
- No entity IDs, service IDs, register names, or unique IDs changed.
- CI not weakened; hassfest and HACS jobs remain intact and blocking.
- Tests not skipped, xfailed, or deleted.
- No broad refactoring performed.
- No new binary brand assets added or replaced (existing assets validated only).
- `quality_scale: silver` retained as self-assessed; subject to CI validation.
