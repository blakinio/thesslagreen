"""Public register mappings for the Thessla Green integration.

This module previously contained large dictionaries generated from the CSV
specification.  The data is now provided by :mod:`loader` which is responsible
for parsing and caching the register information.  The module remains as a
compatibility fa√ßade exposing the same constants as before so existing imports
continue to function.
